# Kotlin Binary to Decimal/Decimal to Binary Converter
## Converts any digit entered

Enter any binary or decimal number, and it will be converted via the appropriate equation. 

Includes basic error checking to stop the user entering wrong values such as letters or symbols.

BUG: If decimal numbers such as 10, 11, 101 etc.. are entered they will be converted from binary to decimal, so eventually this will need to be fixed with an option or flag, or the program will need to be re-written with command-line arguments instead.
